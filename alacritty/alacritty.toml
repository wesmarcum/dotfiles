### Suggested local config

# To override system fonts, add a local configuration to ~/.config/alacritty/local.toml.
# Example below setting font size and using Meslo Nerd Font.

# [font]
# size = 12
#
# normal = { family = "MesloLGS Nerd Font", style = "Regular" }
# bold = { family = "MesloLGS Nerd Font", style = "Bold" }
# bold_italic = { family = "MesloLGS Nerd Font", style = "Bold Italic" }
# italic = { family = "MesloLGS Nerd Font", style = "Italic" }


# Getting the 'alt' modifier key combinations working in macOS requires extra configuration. Setting the 'option_as_alt' window option or
# using key bindings below will be neccessary. The first option is recommended.

# Make `Option` key behave as `Alt` (macOS only):
